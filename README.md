### Hi!

I'm a full-stack web developer currently seeking a full-time position.

Check out my sequencer project at https://simple-sequencer.onrender.com/

Please note that this is an MVP and contains many bugs. 

To-do list:
- [x] Playback sound
- [x] Create grid with selectable buttons using React
- [x] Integrate chord suggestions from the HookTheory API (needs BE)
- [x] Allow users to save and reload songs (needs BE)
- [x] Allow for manipulation of the Web Audio API synth engine (cutoff, attack, decay, etc)
- [x] Select different sounds, some of which are sampled from a single mp3 and pitch-shifted to create different notes
- [ ] Get back-end (BE) live
- [ ] Integrate rock-solid timing by co-ordinating Web Audio's current time with a lookahead note scheduling algorithm
- [ ] Get tempo to reflect real BPM values (currently just approximate)
- [ ] Fix bugs with parameter manipulation, especially when the values are set to extremes (ADSR, tempo, filter, etc)
- [ ] Design UI with inspiration from real-world synth hardware using Figma
- [ ] Finishing touches (tab icon, tab title, song pre-loaded, UX decisions, etc)
